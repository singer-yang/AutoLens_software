# AutoLens software

AutoLens software is an opensource optical design software based on DeepLens.

### Why AutoLens?

- **Opensource.** Commercial optical design software is usually a black-box, researchers have limited control over them and could not freely develop their own functions.
- **Differentiable.** With gradient-based optimization, differentiable optical design is more powerful in both performance and speed than existing software.
- **Imaging.** Based on DeepLens framework, AutoLens is good at image simulation, image-based optimization, and end-to-end optics and network co-design.

### TODO

Since AutoLens is still under development, there are still many functions to be added. The following is a list of directions to be explored.

- [ ] Complete software functions and features to be as close to commercial software as possible.
- [ ] Seamless collaboration with commercial optical design software (ZEMAX, CodeV,...)
- [ ] Better interaction and operation experience.
- [ ] ... (To be added)
